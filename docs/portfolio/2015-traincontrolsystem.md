## Train Control System, 2015
    1) Man Machine Interface.
    2) and Communication simulator with TCP

First project that I had followed practical traditional development process.
Felt difficulties of being under pressure for meeting schedules and being a developer in a team.
Also had experienced the hell of the reviewing documents.

[Korean]
실제 개발  프로세스를 따라 만들었던 첫번째 프로젝트.
일정의 압박과 조직 안에서 개발자로서의 어려움을 처음 느껴보았다.
문서 검토의 지옥도 처음 경험하였다.
