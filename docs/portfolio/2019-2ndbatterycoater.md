## Second-Battery Production(Cathode surface coater part) motor control system, 2019
    * Precise motor control for "Roll to Roll" coater system
    -> Motor speed PID control by comparing roll diameter and tension 
  
Jul 2019 ~ Feb 2020
Worked with PnT for SK Materials 2nd battery production system.
In order to reduce their production cost and to earn technological know-how, PnT decided to buy "My company" motor control system. 
I didn't very much know about motor control-related work because I just experienced software integration before. But I was actually interested in the mechatronics so I tried and finally achieved.
