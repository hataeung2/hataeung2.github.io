## Second-Battery Production (Cathode surface coater part) motor control system, 2019
    * Precise motor control for "Roll to Roll" coater system.
    -> Motor speed PID control by comparing roll diameter and tension.
  
Jul 2019 ~ Feb 2020

A collaboration with PnT for SK Materials' secondary battery production. PnT adopted our motor control system to cut costs and gain know-how. I was new to motor control but had a strong interest in mechatronics, so I dove in and successfully delivered the system.
