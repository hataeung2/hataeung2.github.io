## Servo Press for SIMPAC, 2019
    * Precise motor control for "ServoPress" system
    -> Motor Position Control with Profile
  
Apr 2019 ~ Nov 2019
It was an internal project for selling Motor, Drive, and Software.
Firstly I was forced by my Dr. senior to do this job, and he seemed like enjoying harassment, nevertheless I was very enthusiastic about having this project continued because I felt I learn and I tried to evolve.
Actually, after 2 months of studying this, I realized my Dr. senior knew nothing about the project and wanted to show off his knowledge only. Sad. But still, it was fun to learn by myself from the internet and book. Finally, I got to know much better about "Servo Press" than Dr. senior. But I pretended I knew nothing to survive.
