## Servo Press for SIMPAC, 2019
    * Precise motor control for "ServoPress" system.
    -> Motor Position Control with Profile.
  
Apr 2019 ~ Nov 2019

An internal project designed to showcase our motors, drives, and software. It was a self-driven learning experience—I taught myself using books and online resources. By the end, I knew more about Servo Presses than anyone else in the company. A great experience overall!
